# traffic-editor-web

**EVERYTHING HEREIN IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

This repo will contain a Javascript port and upgrade of the Qt-based traffic-editor previuosly used in RMF.
The editor will be available as a standalone Electron app, or as a JS package suitable for embedding into browser-based user interfaces alongside other RMF UI panels.
